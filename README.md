# card_stack

Companion app for an obscure physical coding challenge, designed for conferences or recruitment fairs. People pick up one of the cards, which will have a number written on it. They rip notches like an old punch card catalog system to represent the nunmber and give it back. 

The card is shuffled into a stack of similar pre-coded cards. This app enables anyone to check if a response is correct. Deploy the app to heroku and visit e.g. <app_name>.herokuapp.com/34 to get the steps to find card number 34:
